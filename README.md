# TheUnnamedVR
A VR multiplayer survival horror.

This project is a test bed for replicated VR for the Oculus Quest 2, using EOS as a backend.
The project can be presently compiled and published for both Desktop and Oculus, and offers a very basic multiplayer lobby system where you can join another user in a VR session, hosted entirely from the Oculus Quest 2.
